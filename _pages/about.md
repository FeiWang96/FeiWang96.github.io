I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/). I am grateful to be co-advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and [Aram Galstyan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJTwW0MAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also fortunate to work closely with [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) at UCLA and [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) at UPenn. My research is supported by the **[Amazon ML PhD Fellowship](https://trustedai.usc.edu/20222023-amazon-ml-fellows-1)** and the **[Annenberg PhD Fellowship](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/fellowships/fellowships-for-phd-students/)**. Previously, I was a research intern at Google Cloud AI, AWS AI Labs, Amazon Alexa AI, and Tencent AI Lab (Seattle).

My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). My recent work is centered around developing **trustworthy (multimodal) LLMs**, with a special focus on enhancing the robustness and reliability in their training, alignment, and inference processes.
