I am a Ph.D. candidate in computer science at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) and a student researcher at [Google](https://research.google/teams/cloud-ai/). I am grateful to be co-advised by [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io) and [Aram Galstyan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rJTwW0MAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also fortunate to work closely with [Kai-Wei Chang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~kwchang/) at UCLA, [Hoifung Poon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/hoifung/) at Microsoft Research, and [Dan Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~danroth/) at UPenn. My research is supported by the **[Amazon ML PhD Fellowship](https://trustedai.usc.edu/20222023-amazon-ml-fellows-1)** and the **[Annenberg PhD Fellowship](https://graduateschool.usc.edu/fellowships/fellowships-for-phd-students/)**, and has been recognized by the **Graduate School Research Award** and the **CS Best Research Award** at USC. Previously, I was a research intern at Google Cloud AI Research, AWS AI Labs, Amazon Alexa AI, and Tencent AI Lab (Seattle).

My research interests lie in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML). My recent work is centered around **developing robust and controllable (multimodal) LLMs**, enhancing their reliability and generalizablity, and thereby ensuring trustworthy and responsible outcomes.
